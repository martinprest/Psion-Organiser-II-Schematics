# Psion Organiser II Schematics
<img align="left" src="Psion2_closed_thumb.jpg" width="100">
Redrawing the Psion Organiser II XP Schematics from an old poor quality FAX and following the description in the Psion Organiser Technical Reference Manual. There are some slight differences between the manual and the FAX. The FAX is for issue 3 boards, these later boards moved one of the clock crystals to the power PCB. The power switch-on circuit was not shown in the FAX and is not that well described in the manual, so I'm guessing or leaving some parts unconnected where I'm not sure.

The new schematics are drawn in KiCAD, which is open source and free to download.
